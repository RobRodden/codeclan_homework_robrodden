# misc observations - the first column with no header and very wide is starting to annoy me!

```{r}
# loading data - this time I've added the data to the same project folder but I did also try doing by direction to the file location
books_data <- read.csv("data/books.csv")

library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
skim(books_data) # need to check this but looks like there are 6 character columns and 7 numeric.  Says no Group variables, not sure what this means.
```

```{r}
# In this section I'm going to check various meta data
nrow(books_data) # there are 11,123
ncol(books_data) # there are 13
dim(books_data) # returned the info I got above
names(books_data) # brings back the column headings - curious as to what the difference between "rowid" and "bookID" plus "isbn" and "isbn13"?  And what is "language_code" or "text_reviews_count"?  Do we need "rowID"? (remember how important it was in previous work).
head(books_data)
head(books_data, 10)
tail(books_data, 10)
glimpse(books_data)
view(books_data)
str(books_data)

publishers_listed <- group_by(books_data, publisher)
summarise(publishers_listed, character_count = n()) # seems to be a lot of publishers with very similar names or upper vs lower case - are they typos etc  Also is this in order?

books_data %>% 
  group_by(publisher) %>% 
summarise(
  count = n()
) %>% 
arrange(count)

```

```{r}
# should look to find any missing data
mutate(books_data, publisher_missing = is.na(publisher))
```
